- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

## Tech Stack

- **Expo** - React Native development platform
- **GluestackUI** - Modern UI component library
- **NativeWind** - Tailwind CSS for React Native

## Database

This project uses Drizzle ORM with Expo SQLite.

  ```bash
  npm run db:generate
  ```

- Migrations are applied at runtime automatically when the app starts (via Drizzle migrator). See `db/README.md` for details and schema examples.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
